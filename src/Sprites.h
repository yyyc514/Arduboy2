     * Assume our cosine is 0.5 (64).

     * // shift left 7 bits to allow room for our fractional
     * x = x << 7;

     * see a fractional difference you'd have to be iterating inside a loop
     * and then converting X back to an integer over time to observe the

/** \brief
 * A class for drawing animated sprites from image and mask bitmaps.
 *
 * \details
 * The functions in this class will draw to the screen buffer an image
 * contained in an array located in program memory. A mask can also be
 * specified or implied, which dictates how existing pixels in the buffer,
 * within the image boundaries, will be affected.
 *
 * A sprite or mask array contains one or more "frames". Each frame is intended
 * to show whatever the sprite represents in a different position, such as the
 * various poses for a running or jumping character. By specifying a different
 * frame each time the sprite is drawn, it can be animated.
 *
 * Each array begins with values for the width and height of the sprite, in
 * pixels. The width can be any value. The height must be a multiple of
 * 8 pixels, but with proper masking, a sprite of any height can be created.
 *
 * After the width and height values, the remainder of the array contains the
 * image and/or mask data for each frame. Each byte represents a vertical
 * column of 8 pixels with the least significant bit (bit 0) at the top.
 * The bytes are drawn as 8 pixel high rows from left to right, top to bottom.
 * When the end of a row is reached, as specified by the width value, the next
 * byte in the array will be the start of the next row.
 *
 * Data for each frame after the first one immediately follows the previous
 * frame. Frame numbers start at 0.
